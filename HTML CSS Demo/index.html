    <h3>·Performance</h3>
    <div class="performance">MacBook Pro elevates the notebook to a whole new level of performance and portability. Wherever your ideas take you, you'll get there faster than ever with high‑performance processors and memory, advanced graphics, blazing‑fast storage, and more.
    </div>
    <h3>·Processor</h3>
    <div class="processor">With eighth-generation Intel Core processors, MacBook Pro reaches new heights in compute performance. A quad‑core processor on the 13‑inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar now makes it up to twice as fast as the previous generation. So when you're powering through pro-level processing jobs like compiling code, rendering 3D models, adding special effects, layering multiple tracks, or encoding video, you'll get everything done. Faster.
    </div>
    <h3>·Graphics</h3>
    <div class="graphics">The 13-inch model with Touch Bar features powerful integrated graphics with 128MB of embedded DRAM - twice as much as the previous generation - which accelerates graphics tasks. That means more time for what matters most - creating amazing work.
    </div>
    <h3>·Apple T2 Chip</h3>
    <div class="t2chip">Introducing the Apple T2 chip — second‑generation custom Mac silicon designed by Apple to make MacBook Pro even more secure. Featured on the 13-inch models with Touch Bar, the Apple T2 chip includes a Secure Enclave coprocessor that provides the foundation for secure boot and encrypted storage capabilities. It also consolidates many discrete controllers, including the system management controller, audio controller, and SSD controller, into one. And the Apple T2 chip brings a familiar voice to MacBook Pro — Hey Siri is always ready to open apps, find documents, play music, or answer your questions.
    </div>
    <h3>·SSD Storage</h3>
    <div class="ssd">MacBook Pro includes a solid-state drive that’s blazing fast, with sequential read speeds up to 3.2GB/s. The 13‑inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is available with up to a 2TB SSD — enough space to take even your biggest files with you, like large photo libraries or video projects. So you can boot up, launch multiple apps, or import huge files in a flash. And with the Apple T2 chip, everything is automatically encrypted on the fly.
    </div>
    <h3>·Thunderbolt 3</h3>
    <div class="thunderbolt">Thunderbolt 3 combines ultra-high bandwidth with the ultra‑versatility of the USB‑C industry standard to create one revved‑up universal port. It integrates data transfer, charging, and video output in a single connector, delivering up to 40Gb/s of throughput for twice the bandwidth of Thunderbolt 2. Both sizes of MacBook Pro are available with up to four ports, so you can do all of that from either side. Existing devices are easily connected with a cable or adapter. And Thunderbolt 3 is reversible, so no matter how you plug in, it's always right side up.
    </div>
    <h3>·Touch Bar</h3>
    <div class="touchbar">The Touch Bar replaces the function keys that have long occupied the top of your keyboard with something much more versatile and capable. It changes automatically based on what you’re doing to show you relevant tools that are intuitive to use — system controls like volume and brightness, interactive ways to adjust or browse through content, and intelligent typing features like emoji and predictive text, just to name a few.
    </div>
    <h3>·Touch ID</h3>
    <div class="touchid">Unlock your Mac in an instant. Use Apple Pay to make secure online purchases. Quickly access system settings and locked notes. And even switch between users — all with the touch of a finger.
    </div>
    <h3>·Display and Audio</h3>
    <div class="da">The Retina display in MacBook Pro is the best ever in a Mac notebook. It features bright LED backlighting and a high contrast ratio, delivering deep blacks and bright whites. It supports P3 wide color for even more vibrant greens and reds than with sRGB. And the 13-inch models with Touch Bar feature True Tone technology. The white balance automatically adjusts to match the color temperature of the light around you — for a more natural viewing experience. MacBook Pro has beautifully balanced, high‑fidelity sound that takes listening to new levels with wide dynamic range and more bass for maximum boom. And the speakers are connected directly to system power, enabling greater peak amplification. So you can mix a track on the fly, edit video on location, or enjoy a movie on the go.
    </div>
    <h3>·Keyboard and Trackpad</h3>
    <div class="kt">The MacBook Pro keyboard features a butterfly mechanism — providing four times more key stability than a traditional scissor mechanism, along with greater comfort. The 13-inch MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar now feature a keyboard with a quieter typing experience. And the spacious Force Touch trackpad gives your fingers plenty of room to gesture and click.
